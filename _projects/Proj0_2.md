title: "Investigating the Impact of Chronic Illness on Cognitive Biases"
excerpt: " <img src='Screenshot 2022-10-15 at 7.32.00 PM.png' width='480' height='480' align='left'> 
Cognitive biases impact the decision-making of patients with a chronic illness. We analyzed the presence of language patterns and psycholinguistic markers characteristic of interpretation and reporting recall cognitive biases within Reddit posts by individuals who have self-disclosed a chronic illness. Visual, interrupted time series and n-gram analyses of associated LIWC dimensions suggest that interpretation bias is more prevalent in Redditors that have self-disclosed a chronic illness and exhibit a statistically significant increase upon self-disclosure.

We inspected the audienceâ€™s perception of gender biases in movies using data from various movie-review-related subreddits. The Bechdel test is a standard test that is used to determine bias in movies, but it has several [problems](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/aug/20/why-the-bechdel-test-doesnt-always-work). Therefore, we aim to use natural audience reviews from Reddit to better determine how people perceive the presence of bias. We also develop classification models for bias and sentiment prediction using pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT.
