Built a dataset using Reddit data from r/PTSD and manually annotated the data to capture different features in PTSD-related posts (symptom type, narrative structure, person involved, etc.). Trained and tested NLP models on the data to perform classification tasks.
Collaborated with Dr. Rosa Arriaga (Georgia Tech) to further enhance and bring domain knowledge to the picture.
Understand the importance of coherence and elaboration in the narrative structure of the posts in terms of coping in patients.
