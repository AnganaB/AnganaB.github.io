We inspected the audienceâ€™s perception of gender biases in movies using data from various movie-review-related subreddits. The Bechdel test is a standard test that is used to determine bias in movies, but it has several [problems](https://www.theguardian.com/lifeandstyle/womens-blog/2016/aug/20/why-the-bechdel-test-doesnt-always-work). Therefore, we aim to use natural audience reviews from Reddit to better determine how people perceive the presence of bias. We also develop classification models for bias and sentiment prediction using pre-trained and fine-tuned BERT.
