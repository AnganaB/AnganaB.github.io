Few Shot learning predicts similarities between samples, then for an unknown sample the learned similarity function can be used to predict queries. Out of cosine, manhattan, euclidean and scaled attention, Manhattan performs the best. We also compared Protonet to pretrained fine-tuned models on text classificatoin tasks and Protonet performs better.
