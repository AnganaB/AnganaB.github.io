I am working on multilinguality, interpretability and model analysis of neural networks in translation tasks. 
- Understanding the translationese phenomenon in human translation by exploring feature learning and feature engineering approaches in translationese classification. The BERT-based model outperforms all other models in both monolingual and multilingual settings. 
- Investigating if representations learned by classifiers, the classifiers’ architecture, or both contribute to the performance difference.
- Utilizing deep learning explainability techniques like integrated gradients and probing to better interpret performance differences.
