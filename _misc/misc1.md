I occasionally blog about ML, NLP (or other) topics on [Medium](https://anganaborah.medium.com/) and [Wordpress](https://tech1840335671.wordpress.com/) (although my Wordpress site has not been updated since 2020)

These are some of my recent blogs:
- [Intro to Translationese](https://anganaborah.medium.com/translationese-a-brief-introduction-db4575c0ee69)
- [Word Embeddings: How do organizations use them to build recommendation systems](https://medium.com/mlearning-ai/word-embeddings-how-do-organizations-use-them-for-building-recommendation-systems-e0341cf5e638)
