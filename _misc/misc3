I love travelling! I recently started going on solo trips and I absolutely love it. Will be happy to hear your thoughts, and suggestions :)
I also try to keep myself active throughout the week, mostly cardio/dance workouts (although I am horrible at dancing :p)
Fun fact about me: I am a black belt in Karate! :D
