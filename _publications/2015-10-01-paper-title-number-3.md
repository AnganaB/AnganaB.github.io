People remain connected with each other across the globe through smart devices. But, it led the current Internet towards scalability issues. Therefore, leaving IP-based Internet behind, the world is moving to the Future Internet Architecture, called Named Data Networking (NDN). Currently, the number of nodes connected to the Internet is in billions and the number of requests sent is in millions per second. NDN handles such huge numbers by modifying the existing IP architecture to meet the current requirements by being scalable, generating less traffic, saving bandwidth, efficiently utilizing multiple network interfaces, providing high-level security, etc. Correspondingly, Bloom Filter is a simple data structure capable of enhancing the performance of NDN. Bloom Filter is deployed in various modules of NDN to handle the enormous number of packets. This survey presents a detailed discussion on the role of Bloom Filter in implementing NDN. Moreover, the article includes a detailed discussion about Bloom Filter and the NDN architectureâ€™s main components: Packet, Content Store, Forwarding Information Base, and Pending Interest Table.
