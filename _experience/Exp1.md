I am working with Dr. Josef van Genabith and Dr. Cristina Espãna Bonet on multilinguality, intepretability and model analysis of neural networks in machine translation. 
- Understanding the translationese phenomenon in human translation by exploring feature learning and feature engineering approaches in translationese classification. The BERT-based model outperforms all other models in both monolingual and multi-lingual settings.
- Investigating if representations learned by classifiers, the classifiers’ architecture, or both contribute to the performance difference. 
- Utilizing deep learning explainability techniques like integrated gradients and probing to better understand performance differences.
