As a summer intern at Microsoft India, I worked on understanding the niche technical requirements of smart city elements like smart traffic, smart parking etc. and developed a framework using serverless and other Microsoft Azure services that can be pitched to prospective clients.
I collaborated with the leadership to build a smart city solution prototype (smart traffic system) at Microsoft Technology Centre.
