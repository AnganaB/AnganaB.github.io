During my time at Microsoft, I worked on facilitating solution building, cloud consumption, digital transformation and project orchestration primarily in Microsoft Azure Data and AI for customers in banking and finance.  
I also worked with a team to build an intelligent ASL (American Sign Language) translator (Shru) and received a D&I (Diversity and Inclusion) achievement award for the project in my respective segment.
