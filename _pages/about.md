Hello, and welcome to my website! I am Angana Borah, an incoming Computer Science and Engineering Ph.D. student at the [University of Michigan, Ann Arbor](https://cse.engin.umich.edu/academics/graduate/graduate-programs/phd-in-cse/). Prior to this, I completed my master's in Computer Science at [Georgia Tech](https://www.cc.gatech.edu/). **My research interests are in Natural Language Processing and Machine Learning, specifically in fairness and bias mitigation, multilingualism, and interpretability.** 

During my master's, I was a research intern at the [German Research Centre for Artificial Intelligence](https://www.dfki.de/web) in the [Language Technology and Multilingualism](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/sprachtechnologie-und-multilingualitaet) group and [Universität des Saarlandes](https://www.uni-saarland.de/start.html) under [Dr. Josef van Genabith](https://www.uni-saarland.de/lehrstuhl/genabith.html) and [Dr. Cristina España Bonet](https://www.dfki.de/web/forschung/forschungsbereiche/sprachtechnologie-und-multilingualitaet/mt-team), where I am working on problems related to translationese, multilingualism and explainability of neural models in translation (or related) tasks. 

Since the summer of 2022, I have been working as a research intern at the [Pennebaker Language Lab](https://www.words.live/) under the guidance of [Dr. James W. Pennebaker](https://liberalarts.utexas.edu/psychology/faculty/pennebak) on natural language understanding in social media. Prior to my master's, I worked at Microsoft for a year after completing my Bachelors in Computer Science and Engineering at the National Institute of Technology, Silchar. During my Bachelors, I worked under the guidance of [Dr. Badal Soni](http://cs.nits.ac.in/badal/) on Computer Vision, specifically on Content-Based Image Retrieval Systems and [Dr. Ripon Patgiri](http://cs.nits.ac.in/rp/) on Bloom Filters in Named Data Networking.
